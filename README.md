# Data Analysis Project: Survey Results Analysis Dashboard

This project is a data analysis of a survey that asks people who work in data about several questions like their role name, salary, work-life balance satisfaction, where they live, and their favorite programming language and more. The data was collected and analyzed using Microsoft Power BI.

## Data

The data was collected from a survey of individuals who work in the field of data. The dataset includes responses from hundreds of participants and includes information such as job title, salary, location, work-life balance satisfaction, and favorite programming language. The data was preprocessed and cleaned before being loaded into Power BI.

## Analysis

Using Microsoft Power BI, we created an interactive dashboard to explore the survey results. The dashboard includes visualizations of the survey data such as charts and graphs that help to identify patterns and trends in the data. We also conducted in-depth analysis on the data to gain insights into the survey results.

## Results

The dashboard provides an in-depth look at the survey results and provides insights into the attitudes and behaviors of people who work in data. The visualizations in the dashboard help to highlight key patterns and trends in the data. For example, we discovered that the majority of participants were partially satisfied with their work-life balance, and Python was the most popular programming language among the survey respondents.

## Future Work

Future work includes expanding the survey to include a larger sample size and conducting more detailed analysis on the data. We also plan to use the insights gained from this survey to inform future research on the attitudes and behaviors of people who work in data.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project provides a comprehensive analysis of the survey results from individuals who work in the field of data. Using Microsoft Power BI, we were able to create an interactive dashboard that provides insights into the attitudes and behaviors of people who work in data. This analysis can be used to inform future research on this topic and can provide valuable insights to individuals and organizations working in the field of data.
